# 🌸 Bengali Language & Culture Learning App

> **Connecting Generations. Celebrating Heritage. Empowering Community.**

This is an early-stage nonprofit project to help second-generation Bengali immigrants and curious learners connect with the Bengali language, culture, and community.  
Our goal is to preserve and celebrate Bengali heritage through fun, interactive lessons and cultural immersion activities.

We’re just getting started — and we’re building this with care, love, and community input!
